What I Do Best

	•	Building "Human-Centric" AI: Designing agents that handle logistics without sounding like robots (Context-aware, Persona-driven).
	•	Operational Automation: Turning manual business chaos (SMS, scheduling, invoices) into silent, automated pipelines.
	•	Rapid Prototyping: going from "Idea" to "Live Pilot" in days, not months.

⸻

Goals

	•	Build Vertical AI: Creating deep, specialized agents for specific industries (Food & Bev, Service Ops) rather than shallow wrappers.
	•	Democratize Automation: Building tools that give small business owners (Chefs, Mechanics, Artists) the same leverage as big corporations.
	•	Share progress & lessons publicly along the way

## Leveling Up in Public

Right now, my GitHub is basically a construction site —  
half-finished tools, debug notes, and the occasional “aha!” moment.  
I’m here to **ship, break, fix, and repeat** until the tools I build pay for themselves (and then some).
